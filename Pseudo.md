As an uninformed user I need to display the weather by zip code.

Program Flow

global - set default vars and const

init- initialize the state, handlers, and render the view on load of the body

render - display the info and data stored in state

fetchWeatherData - pass in a zip code and return JSOn data to the state 

handler - onload, click

state - zip code, weather date, 

input - user supply the zip code (get the user's geolocation and use it instead of location)
